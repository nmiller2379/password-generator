# password-generator

This project is a password generator designed to allow a user to generate a password ranging in length from 8 to 128 characters.

The application also allows users to decide what they want to include in the password, such as special characters and numerals.

## Challenges

As of right now the application is not fully functional. I was able to write functional javascript code to declare variables and prompt the user for the information needed to initiate the password generation process, but I was not able to write code that would randomly generate the password.
